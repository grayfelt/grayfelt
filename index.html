                    Last week was the one month mark in Tartu. Somehow, life here is starting to feel normal. I think participating in the routine of classes and
                    exploring the city has facilitated this change. My classes are going well by the way! I have met many students in my program, all of which have
                    been very helpful and kind to me.

                    Even though I now live thousands of miles away, it sometimes feels as if I am just a quick train ride away from home. And at other times it
                     feels like I am on a different planet. I guess, with the internet and other technologies, I am only seconds away (and a handful of timezones).
                    I still miss everyone anyways. So come visit!

                    Tere! Hello!
                    <br>
                    I arrived in Estonia just a few days ago and have settled into my apartment. Tartu, the city which I am studying in, is even more beautiful than
                    I anticipated. So far I have visited medieval cathedrals, enjoyed operas and ballets, walked cobblestone streets, and met lots of new friends
                    from around the world! Classes start tomorrow which I am of course nervous about, but more than anything I am excited to continue this adventure.
                    Check this website for udpates as I will try to continute posting consistently. See you then!
